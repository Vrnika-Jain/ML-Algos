# Supervised Algorithms
## **Linear Regression**
Linear regression is a simple algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 
### Implementation
The `LinearRegression` class is implemented from scratch using NumPy for matrix operations. The implementation includes methods for training the model using gradient descent and making predictions.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It is a fundamental technique in binary classification tasks.
### Implementation
The LogisticRegression class is implemented from scratch using NumPy for matrix operations. The implementation includes methods for training the model using gradient descent, making predictions, and a helper function for the sigmoid function.
